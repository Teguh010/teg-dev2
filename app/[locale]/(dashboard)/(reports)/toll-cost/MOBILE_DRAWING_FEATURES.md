# Mobile-Friendly Drawing Features

## Overview
This document describes the mobile-friendly improvements made to the HERE Maps drawing functionality to address the lack of hover events on touch devices.

## Problem
On desktop devices, users can hover over shapes to see:
- Delete buttons (X) for removing shapes
- Vertex markers for reshaping polygons
- Visual feedback for interactive elements

On mobile devices, hover events don't exist, making these features inaccessible.

## Solution
We've implemented mobile-specific event handling that provides the same functionality through touch events.

## Features

### 1. Rectangle Shape Management
**Desktop (Hover):**
- Hover over rectangle → Delete button appears
- Click delete button → Shape is removed

**Mobile (Tap):**
- Tap rectangle → Delete button appears immediately
- Tap rectangle again → Delete button toggles off
- Tap delete button → Shape is removed

### 2. Circle Shape Management
**Desktop (Hover):**
- Hover over circle → Delete button appears
- Click delete button → Shape is removed

**Mobile (Tap):**
- Tap circle → Delete button appears immediately
- Tap circle again → Delete button toggles off
- Tap delete button → Shape is removed

### 3. Polygon Shape Management
**Desktop (Hover):**
- Hover over polygon → Vertex markers appear
- Drag vertex markers → Reshape polygon
- Hover over vertex → Cursor changes to pointer

**Mobile (Tap):**
- Tap polygon → Vertex markers appear immediately
- Drag vertex markers → Reshape polygon
- Vertex markers auto-hide after 2 seconds of inactivity
- Tap polygon again → Vertex markers toggle off

### 4. Polyline Shape Management
**Desktop (Hover):**
- Hover over polyline → Delete button appears
- Click delete button → Shape is removed

**Mobile (Tap):**
- Tap polyline → Delete button appears immediately
- Tap polyline again → Delete button toggles off
- Tap delete button → Shape is removed

### 5. Drawing Controls
**Desktop:**
- 34px button size
- Hover effects for visual feedback

**Mobile:**
- 44px button size (iOS recommended touch target)
- Touch events (touchend) in addition to click events
- Larger icons for better visibility

## Technical Implementation

### Mobile Detection
```typescript
const isMobile = 'ontouchstart' in window || navigator.maxTouchPoints > 0;
```

### Event Handling
- **Desktop**: Uses `pointerenter`/`pointerleave` events
- **Mobile**: Uses `tap` events with `stopPropagation()` to prevent map click events

### Event Propagation
Shapes now properly handle events to prevent them from bubbling up to the map:
```typescript
evt.stopPropagation(); // Prevent map click events
```

### Button Sizing
- Desktop: 34px × 34px
- Mobile: 44px × 44px (iOS recommended minimum)

## CSS Styling
Mobile-specific styles are applied using media queries:
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  #here-geoshape-controls button {
    min-height: 44px;
    min-width: 44px;
  }
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

### 1. Immediate Feedback
- No more waiting for hover on mobile
- Instant visual feedback when tapping shapes

### 2. Touch-Friendly Sizing
- Buttons meet iOS/Android touch target guidelines
- Adequate spacing between interactive elements

### 3. Consistent Behavior
- Same functionality across desktop and mobile
- Intuitive tap-to-interact pattern

### 4. Visual Clarity
- Clear visual indicators for interactive elements
- Smooth transitions and animations

## Testing
Test these features on:
- Desktop browsers (hover behavior)
- Mobile browsers (tap behavior)
- Touch-enabled laptops (hybrid behavior)

## Future Enhancements
- Long-press context menus for additional options
- Gesture-based shape manipulation
- Haptic feedback on supported devices
- Accessibility improvements for screen readers
